# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Why this app?

I made this app as a fun little side project because I like eating at Panda Express and often want to check the macros for the food I am eating. Panda Expresses [Nutrition Guide](https://www.pandaexpress.com/nutritioninformation) is pretty lacking in features so I decided to write my own that would easily calculate the macros for the meal I wanted, or I could use it to find a meal that would fit the macros that I have remaining.
